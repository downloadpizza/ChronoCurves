# Usage

- Have vJoy installed and Controller 1 set up with whatever axis you need active.
- Write your config.toml as wanted
- Start the ChronoCurves.exe
- Consider that the Buttons are not supressed so you may need to unbind WASD, I dont want to deal with supressing keys so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

# Contributing

- Make a fork
- Make your changes
    - If I like them I will accept them into upstream
    - If I do not like them you are free to maintain your own version and to copy other changes I or others make downstream (follow MIT)

# Archival

For the moment this project is going to stay "alive", but it is unlikely to receive changes by me (DownloadPizza) since I am happy with how it turned
out and consider it done™

# Credits

I wrote this because someone on the Nuclear Option Discord was annoyed that the inputs on keyboard are digital with no way to make soft adjustments.

thanks to Renblo from the Nuclear Option Discord for helping me test the pre-pre-pre-alpha (which was a way larger mess than this already messy code, you do not want to see it)

thanks to the SFML Discord for helping me with Keyboard stuff that I did ended up not needing in the end (this is the previously mentioned key supression stuff) (4 hours that I will never get back)

# "I need help doing a decent config"

I honestly don't have time to help with configs. The default config has a lot of comments, if I forgot something you may have to check out the mess of code.
I will not be providing support (you can make PRs to clear things up though)
